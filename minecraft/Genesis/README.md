# Project Genesis

Project Genesis was my first introduction into game modding and one of the first "hack" clients for Minecraft Windows 10 Edition.

Weblinks inside might be outdated. 

## This is really outdated and for old game vesions. 

I think the last supported version was somewhere around 1.13.0. If you have old CTs of Genesis lying around let me know :)

I covered many features on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVRYtYhvPXj7v3Mo42FW3vDqluYskAcHE
